# GAttANet-Replication
GAttANet-Replication is a forward-only PyTorch implementation of the Global Attention Agreement mechanism, translating the theoretical model into a modular code structure. It augments frozen CNN backbones with a global attention system that measures agreement between local features and a single global query.
